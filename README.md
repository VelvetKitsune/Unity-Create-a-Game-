# Unity-Create-a-Game-
Greetings! This is a thing I'm playing around with by watching the tutorials from Sebastian Lague https://www.youtube.com/user/Cercopithecan

I might make something of this at some point, but the intention as it is right now is just to learn more of Unity.

Music used currently are both from the Ys series. Windslash Steps for the Menu, and Norse Wind for the main gameplay.
